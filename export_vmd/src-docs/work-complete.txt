*******************************************************************************
This document describes the Vegetation Management Data Exchange Format (VMDEF)
file format, which can be used to work complete data from external sources.

09-03-2015	Initial Specification 
10-14-2015	Added section for pictures of tree after work is completed
11-16-2015	Added ExternalTreeID, ExternalWRID
02-01-2016	Missing / in closing tags, dropped <ExternalLocID>, some 
			clarifications in descriptions, and object nesting
			Added <ExternalWRParams> section to create adhoc work requests
06-23-2016	Some of the ExternalWRParam are no longer required
*******************************************************************************
File Structure and naming convention:
The VMDEF file will be a text file containing standard XML tag data in a format
described below.  The file should have the extension (.WC) and use a unique
naming convention as it will be placed onto a file-share queue for automated
import.

A work complete record refers to a specific line item on a work request
that was issued to a tree crew.  The work complete record indicates what work
if any was done for the tree.

To link to the source data from other systems, a field
was added at the tree level to link back to source data: <ExternalTreeID>
